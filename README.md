# Gesture-Controller-for-Dyslexic-Patients
This project is aimed to detect pattern generated by coloured pointer though a camera. This will be achieved using OpenCV and numpy libraries
of Python. This project has been inspired from the sixth-sense technology developed by an Indian scientist Pranav Mistry. In this project,
similar idea has been used. Dyslexic patients can use a pointer to make gestures in front of a camera. The applicaton will
recognise the gesture and display the letter made by the user. This project can easily be extended to make it applicable for many other
useful purposes by adding more features to this existing application.
